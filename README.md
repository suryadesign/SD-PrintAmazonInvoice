# SD-PrintAmazonInvoice
This bookmarklet does the following:
1. Extracts the order date from an Amazon invoice page
2. Changes the page title to "YYYYMMDD Amazon - XXX"
3. Opens the print dialog so that it can be saved as PDF with the page title as the filename

I'm not much of a JS coder, so bare with me.
